**This install script will get you 95% ready to go with yiimp. There are a few things you need to do after the main install is finished.**

While I did add some server security to the script, it is every server owners responsibility to fully secure their own servers. After the installation you will still need to customize your serverconfig.php file to your liking, add your API keys, and build/add your coins to the control panel.

There will be several wallets already in yiimp. These have nothing to do with the installation script and are from the database import from the yiimp github.
